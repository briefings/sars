The positivity rate is one of the most contentious.  There are three excellent COVID Tracking Project blogs that outline the dangers/flaws/unreliability of the positivity rates.</p>");

    "hence positivity rates should not be compared.  Why isn't it a metric?  In brief, it is not “a numerical observation based on standard systems, methods, " +
    "calculations, and data sources”.  Hence, the positivity rates of countries, states, or counties, for example, should not be compared.  An entity may compare " +
    "rates across its administrative regions if the entity has meticulously set-up testing, recording, calculation standards across all institutions → this is rare.</p>"
